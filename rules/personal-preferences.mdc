# Personal Preferences & Autonomous Context

## Session Start Protocol

At the start of EVERY session in a git repository, silently run:
```bash
git config --get-regexp "^project\." 2>/dev/null
test -d .git/local-context && ls .git/local-context/
```

Use what you find. Don't ask questions already answered in context.

## Autonomous Context Storage

You are expected to **proactively store valuable information** discovered during sessions. Do not ask permission - just store and briefly mention it.

### High-Value Information (ALWAYS Store)

| Discovery | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Test command works | `git config --local project.test-cmd "..."` |
| Found dev/build command | `git config --local project.dev-cmd "..."` |
| Identified architecture | `git config --local project.architecture "..."` |
| User corrects me | Add to `.cursor/rules/local-preferences.mdc` |
| Complex setup steps | Append to `.git/local-context/setup.md` |
| Non-obvious code pattern | Append to `.git/local-context/patterns.md` |
| External API details | Append to `.git/local-context/integrations.md` |
| Debugging insight | Append to `.git/local-context/troubleshooting.md` |

### Storage Phrases

After storing, say ONE of:
- "I've noted that for future sessions."
- "Saved for next time."
- "I'll remember that."

After updating outdated info, say ONE of:
- "Updated my notes - [what changed]."
- "Fixed the stored [thing] - it's now [new value]."
- "That's changed, I've updated it."

Do NOT ask "Would you like me to save/update this?" - just do it.

### Detecting Outdated Information

Update stored context when:
- A stored command fails → find working command, update git config
- A stored path doesn't exist → find new path, update notes
- User says "that's old/wrong/changed" → update immediately
- Dependencies don't match stored framework → update git config
- Code structure contradicts stored architecture → update notes

Always verify stored commands before running them if the project might have changed.

## Code Style

- Prefer explicit over implicit
- Descriptive variable names
- Small, focused functions
- Tests for critical paths
- Comments explain "why", not "what"

## When to Suggest Team Documentation

If you discover something that would help the whole team (not just personal notes), suggest:
- "This seems like it should be in `.cursor/rules/` for the team - want me to create it?"

Only suggest, don't auto-create committed files.
